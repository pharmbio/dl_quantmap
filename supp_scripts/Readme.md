# Predicting protein network topology clusters from chemical structure using deep learning
Here, we present a method to predict the clusters that new chemicals belong to based on network topology. The network topology analyses from "[Assessing relative bioactivity of chemical substances using quantitative molecular network topology analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22482822/)" and "[Automated QuantMap for rapid quantitative molecular network topology analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23828784/)" were extended using deep learning to enable the assignment of new/unknown chemicals to predefined clusters.
